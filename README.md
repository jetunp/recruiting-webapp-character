# Instructions

You will build a small web app around creating a character sheet for a tabletop RPG game like DnD, Pathfinder etc.

Find the requirements below, but it’s not expected that all of them will be complete. Please work in top-down order as best you can, unless you feel the need to move on because you’re stuck etc.

The goal is to see some of your code in the context of this problem, if things look good we’ll schedule a followup meeting to discuss the implementation details, some design choices you made, how we might extend this further, and some other technical questions.

Please spend NO MORE THAN 2 hours on this. We don’t expect all requirements to be completed, and are more interested in your approach to the project and how you’re solving problems than the output at the end of this 2-hour limit.

Please view this short video of a partial implementation of the features below to give you an idea of what we’re asking for: https://www.loom.com/share/3afa00385d2d4fbc9720b88360036a54

Styling is not important, so long as the JS functionality is present and usable.

The 2 hours begins once you've read these instructions and run the application.

## What is a character sheet?

Character sheets are defined by the following high-level concepts
- Attributes: This represents a character's raw abilities 
- Attribute Modifier: calculated using the related Attribute, this value affects a character's skills
- Skills: A character's ability to perform a specific action



## Requirements

1. Create state and controls for each of the 6 attributes (see `ATTRIBUTE_LIST`) so they can be incremented/decremented independently.
2. Display classes on the screen (see `CLASS_LIST`) and visually change the UI when the character meets the minimum requirements for that class, that is, all attributes are greater than or equal to the class minimums
3. When clicking on a class, display the minimum required statistics for that class
4. Add an “ability modifier” to each attribute row, this is calculated as +1 for each 2 points above 10, for any attribute (let's take Intelligence for example) we would have the following ability modifiers for a given ability
  - Intelligence: 7 -> Intelligence Modifier: -2
  - Intelligence: 9 -> Intelligence Modifier: -1
  - Intelligence: 10 -> Intelligence Modifier: 0
  - Intelligence: 11 -> Intelligence Modifier: 0
  - Intelligence: 12 -> Intelligence Modifier: 1
  - Intelligence: 14 -> Intelligence Modifier: 2
  - Intelligence: 20 -> Intelligence Modifier: 5
5. Implement skills. See `SKILL_LIST` for the list of all skills and their attribute modifier 
  - Characters have 10 + (4 * Intelligence Modifier) points to spend between skills.
    - There is a minimum of 0, but no maximum aside from the total points available to spend.
    - for example, if a character has a 1 Intelligence Modifier, they may spend 14 points, and could add 7 to both Acrobatics and Perception (then would have no more to spend on others)
  - The total value of a skill is the sum of points spent and the skill’s corresponding ability modifier (see `SKILL_LIST` for what ability modifier affects each skill). 
    - For example. a character with a 2 Dexterity Modifier and spending 3 points on Acrobatics would have a total skill value of 5
  - Display each skill in a row in a separate section. For example, Acrobatics 
    - for a character with 12 dexterity may look like `Acrobatics - points: 3 [+] [-] modifier (Dex): 2 total: 5`
6. Save the character(s) to an API so they can be retrieved when the app starts next time. 
    - Make a post request with a JSON payload to https://recruiting.verylongdomaintotestwith.ca/api/{{github_username}}/character to save data, and a get request to https://recruiting.verylongdomaintotestwith.ca/api/{{github_username}}/character to retrieve the data. It will accept any valid JSON blob and return the most recent version
    - for example, if your github username is mjohnston, you would use https://recruiting.verylongdomaintotestwith.ca/api/{mjohnston}/character (include the curly braces)
    - you must include a content-type header of application/json for the post to be accepted 
7. Implement a maximum on all attributes of 70. For example, if a character has 20 strength and 10 for all other attributes, they must decrease one before they can increase another
8. Add the ability to edit multiple characters simultaneously with the same rules above
9. Add a Skill Check section for each character. This represents a character's attempt to perform an action
    - the character is successful if they meet or exceed the DC (see below) of the skill check. Add the total skill to a random number between 1 and 20 inclusive, if this meets or exceeds the DC the skill check is successful, otherwise it's a failure
    - Add the following controls to the UI
      - skill: a dropdown to specify what skill we're using in the check, see `SKILL_LIST`
      - DC: An input that collects a number. The minimum value the character must meet to succeed
      - Roll: a button that will trigger the random number generation
    - When the Roll button is clicked, display the following
      - What the random number generated was
      - If the skill check is successful or a failure
10. Add a party skill check section. This is the same as the above, except we should use the character with the highest skill total to attempt the action
  - Show which character was selected to attempt the action
